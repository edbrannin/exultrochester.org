Exult Rochester held the first Diocese of Rochester Catholic Men's Conference on May 16th 2015 at St Jude The Apostle Church in Gates, NY. Over 500 men attended and made the inaugural conference a huge success. The Sacrifice of the Holy Mass was celebrated by His Excellency, the most reverend Bishop Matano. **Gospel & Homily** [audio mp3="http://exultrochester.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/05-Gospel-Homily.mp3"][/audio] Speakers included; **Tim Staples** ![tim](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/tim.jpg) Tim Staples is Director of Apologetics and Evangelization here at Catholic Answers, but he was not always Catholic. Tim was raised a Southern Baptist. Although he fell away from the faith of his childhood, Tim came back to faith in Christ during his late teen years through the witness of Christian televangelists. Soon after, Tim joined the Marine Corps. During his four-year tour, he became involved in ministry with various Assemblies of God communities. Immediately after his tour of duty, Tim enrolled in Jimmy Swaggart Bible College and became a youth minister in an Assembly of God community. During his final year in the Marines, however, Tim met a Marine who really knew his faith and challenged Tim to study Catholicism from Catholic and historical sources. That encounter sparked a two-year search for the truth. Tim was determined to prove Catholicism wrong, but he ended up studying his way to the last place he thought he would ever end up: the Catholic Church! He converted to Catholicism in 1988 and spent the following six years in formation for the priesthood, earning a degree in philosophy from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, Pennsylvania. He then studied theology on a graduate level at Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, for two years. Realizing that his calling was not to the priesthood, Tim left the seminary in 1994 and has been working in Catholic apologetics and evangelization ever since. Click below to hear Tim Staples.

He served in this capacity for over a decade before relocating to the Archdiocese of St. Louiswhere he served for six years as Director of Hispanic Ministry and later as founding Director of The Office for the New Evangelization.
