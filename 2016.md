Mitchell Pacwa, S.J.** ![2016-Pacwa](/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2016-Pacwa-214x300.jpg) In the year 2000, Father Mitchell Pacwa, S.J. established Ignatius Productions, a Catholic media production apostolate, under the Society of Jesus, whose mission is to teach people the scriptures, educate Catholics about their Faith, and promote unity and understanding within the Mystical Body of Christ.

Father Pacwa received his B.A. in Philosophy and Theology from the University of Detroit, summa cum laude. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1976 with the Society of Jesus and then continued his studies and then received his Master of Divinity and S.T.B. from the Jesuit School of Theology of Loyola University, magna cum laude. At Vanderbilt University, he received his Master of Arts as well as his Ph.D. in Old Testament.

 

Father Pacwa is fluent in twelve languages and has a unique understanding of the peoples and cultures of the Middle East. Father’s extensive travels to the Holy Land has inspired him to write the “Holy Land Prayer Book,” which has been published by his Jesuit apostolate, Ignatius Productions. Father Pacwa also has the privilege of being bi-ritual, which means he also celebrates the Maronite Mass of the Eastern Catholic Church.

 

He is best known for his appearances on the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), where he currently hosts two television programs – “Threshold of Hope” and “EWTN LIVE” and as the weekly host of EWTN Radio “OPEN LINE” program.

 

Father Pacwa is a best-selling Catholic author and you can find his books and follow his speaking schedule, pilgrimage information, CDs and DVDs and now MP3 files available on his web site at: [events.fathermitchpacwa.o](http://events.fathermitchpacwa.org)[rg](http://events.fathermitchpacwa.org)
